            <h2>Accepting or Denying Cookies</h2>
            <p>Here are three ways that accepting cookies could help you:

                Website access: The first advantage is simple: Without consenting to cookies, some websites won’t grant access.
                Improved user experience: Cookies can be helpful because they help sites remember you. This memory can help improve your 
                individual user experience. Why is this a good thing? They already know about you and can tailor your 
                website experience to your interests — making your browsing experience quicker, more focused, and more helpful. This more 
                personalized experience can be especially helpful when online shopping. For example, when you revisit a website, it could remember 
                shopping cart items you haven’t yet purchased. Cookies can make the shopping process quicker, more convenient, and more successful.
                Easy log-ins: Cookies saved on your web browser also can remember your log-in credentials. This can come in handy when repeatedly 
                logging in to your go-to websites, especially if you sometimes forget your passwords.
