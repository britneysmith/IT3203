    <h2>Why Is SEO Important?</h2>
    <p>
      SEO serves as a vital method to boost website visibility through organic means rather than advertising expenses. The majority of internet users start their searches through search engines before selecting results from the initial few positions according to Moz. When your website ranks higher it becomes more trustworthy and attracts additional visitors. Search Engine Journal explains that SEO enables users to discover your content while enhancing their experience which drives more clicks and engagement and supports long-term growth.

    <h2>Key Parts of Good SEO</h2>
    <p>
      Good SEO requires three essential elements for success.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-Page SEO:</strong> Requires creating high-quality content while implementing keywords and designing pages with clear organization.  Moz emphasizes that useful content stands as the key factor for achieving good search engine rankings.</li>
      <li><strong>Off-Page SEO:</strong> Requires obtaining links from reliable websites because Ahrefs confirms these links indicate your site's credibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> Google's SEO guide emphasizes that your website needs to have fast loading times and mobile compatibility and security features for technical SEO.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
